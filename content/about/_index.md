I am an iOS Developer with passion in making impactful products. 

I have experience with working on consumer iOS apps with a large user base and also on numerous smaller mobile app projects. I deliver high level UI features involving UIKit, SwiftUI and AR, but also low level details such as sensors and bluetooth on the iOS devices.

Apart from work, I like hiking, woodworking, sports, being in the nature, music, edgy jokes, food, cooking and learning something I couldn't do yesterday. When I was a child, I was always a natural fun leader in the class. I was always good at finding a hidden funny person in a classroom. Many introverts flourished their personality when they were in the same class with me. My strength and mission is being a good human/thinker before being a developer. Let's build something nice!
