[App Clip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/) is a feature released by Apple in 2019. 

It has direct integration with Apple Map, Safari, Apple Messages. It can also be invoked by NFC tags and QR codes. In the simplest summary, the App experience became available without users explicitly installing the app. You can scan a QR code or click on a place on Apple Map, and the app will be on your phone. 
Of course, such easy access doesn't come for free. The app needs to follow some standards, for instance, not flooding the users with notifications, limited access to personal information, and the app's size limitation.

In the context of Tiqets, AppClip on Apple Map was particularly interesting. Tiqets is an app where users can purchase tickets for museums across the world. By providing Tiqets App Clip on the Apple Map, users can have a seamless experience from searching a place on Apple Map to getting into a venue with the instant tickets that Tiqets provides.

It was a very successful project and caught momentum within the company and became the most important project of the company in 2020-2021. Tiqets AppClip on Apple Map is the most profitable channel for Tiqets in 2022.
