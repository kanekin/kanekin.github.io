Tiqets is an app where users can purchase tickets for museums across the world. I saw a potential in App Clip for Tiqets after watching sessions on WWDC in 2020. I called up a meeting with the COO and the head of product, and delivered a working prototype in two weeks. It caught a momentum within the company and became the most important project of the company in 2020-2021. Tiqets App Clip on Apple Map is the most profitable channel for Tiqets in 2022.

One look worth a thousand words! Open your Apple Map and checkout Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam), Sagrada Familia (Barcelona), MoMA(New York) and more!
