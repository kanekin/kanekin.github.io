[App Clip](https://developer.apple.com/app-clips/) is a feature released by Apple in 2019. In the most straightforward summary, the App experience became available without users installing the app. It has direct integration with Apple Map, Safari, and Apple Messages. It can also be invoked by NFC tags and QR codes. You can scan a QR code or click on a place on Apple Map, and the app will be on your phone. Of course, such easy access doesn't come for free. The app needs to follow some standards, for instance, not flooding the users with notifications, limited access to personal information, and the app's size limitation.
In the context of Tiqets, AppClip on Apple Map was particularly interesting. Tiqets is an app where users can purchase tickets for museums worldwide. By providing Tiqets App Clip on the Apple Map, users can have a seamless experience from Apple Map to getting into a venue with instant tickets.

It was a very successful project and caught momentum within the company and became the company's most important project in 2020-2021. Tiqets AppClip on Apple Map is the most profitable channel for Tiqets in 2022.
