Filterable items on map component.
A common iOS UI pattern that can be found in many apps. 
<!--more-->

A very popular UI pattern, a map UI with filters. You can find this type of pattern in many apps, such as TooGoodToGo, OneFit/ClassPass, E-Mobility apps such as Felyx, GO, CHECK, SnappCar, Sixt Sharing, MyWheels and etc
## Dynamic filters

What is unique about the map filters that we implemented at Tiqets is that new filters can be introduced without releasing a new version of the mobile app itself. We abstracted the filters and the list items so that we could introduce a new set of filters by the backend change alone. We were able to quickly A/B test the filters that are more useful for users. 
Combined with the analytics data, we were able to see which filters were used more useful for the users and optimize the map UI.
