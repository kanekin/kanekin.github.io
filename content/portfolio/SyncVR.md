SyncVR is a company that develops VR applications used in medical contexts. I have built an iOS app that allows nurses to remote control the VR headset to guide the patient in VR.

There are attempts to utilize VR to alleviate the pains and discomfort of patients in forward-thinking hospitals in the Netherlands. For example, people who suffer from kidney failure must go through dialysis treatments twice a week. It is an unpleasant procedure for the patient as they have to inject a thick needle and stay in bed for hours. 

SyncVR headsets are used in the hospital during the treatments like dialysis. There are reports that VR effectively reduces pain and discomfort. Patients can reduce or skip anesthesia, which is the preferred approach as it is less invasive and reduces medical bills.

## My role in the project:
- I worked as a freelance iOS developer individually.
- I have built an app to remote-control the VR headset.
