SyncVR is a company that develops VR applications used in medical contexts. I have built an iOS app allows nurses to remote control the VR headset to guide the patient in VR.

There are attempts to utilize VR to alleviate the pains and discomfort of patients in forward-thinking hospitals in the Netherlands. For example, people who suffer from kidney failure have to go through dialysis treatments a couple of times a week. It is an unpleasant procedure for the patient as he/she has to inject a thick needle and has to stay in the bed for hours. 

SyncVR headsets are used in the hospital during the treatments like dialysis. There are reports that VR is effective in reducing the pains and discomfort so much that in some cases patients can reduce or skip anesthesia, which is the preferred approach as it is less invasive and it also reduces the medical bills.

## My role in project:
- I worked as a freelance iOS developer individually.
- I have built a remote control app to remote control the VR headset based on the Android counter part app.
