Tickets being automatically available right after installation. It's magic!

Tickets is an app where a user can purchase a ticket for cultural venues such as museum and touristic attractions. One of common problems among any consumer facing app is that sometimes users can not figure out how to use the app.

I think Tiqets app is a fairly simple app. You purchase a ticket in the app and you have the ticket in a minute. That's it! Show the ticket in the app at the venue and everything is done fast.

 However, we also have another path that many users also goes through. That is when a user purchase a ticket on the web and install the app afterwards. In this scenario, a user has to authenticate himself in order to get the ticket that he ordered on a web browser. Perhaps the order took place on a different device from the mobile app where he wants to get the ticket. 

Even though it's relatively straightforward steps, but still many things can go wrong. For example, Email address can be input incorrectly filled when purchasing the ticket. And belive me it happens much more often than you would think. In such a unhappy path, the only option the user had was to contact the customer service. The user was expecting to finish the entire process within 5 mins and now suddenly they have to calle somebody. It is a big problem for Tiqets. Tiqets is meaningless if the customer journey is fast, simple and pleasant. 

That is why Tiqets mobile team worked on the magical tickets fetch functionality. We built a system where we send the confirmation message in email or sms. When you click the url, we will make sure that you will have the ticket you ordered as soon as you launch the app.  

What's even better is that even if you don't have the app at the moment of clicking the url in the confirmation email/sms, you will still get the ticket as soon as you install the app. This was difficult to achieve but we made it work. I can not reveal how that exactly works under the nutshell, but it was an amazing improvement for the users journey. We reduced the rate of contact from users to our customer service drastically.
