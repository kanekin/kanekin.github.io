React Native SDK for iOS Health Kit. It enabled React Native apps to subscribe Health Kit data updates. 

<!--more-->
It took a lot of researching and debugging to enable receiving the updates from Health Kit while the app was in the background. It was an exciting challenge to orchestrate the timing of life cycles between iOS and React Native layers.


## My role in this project
- Researching lifecycles of ReactNative and iOS apps.
- Made a prototype to enable React Native layer to get awakened while the app is in the background.
- Delivered the ReactNative SDK to enable background data stream from iOS HealthKit.
