React Native SDK for iOS Health Kit. It enabled React Native apps to subscribe Health Kit data updates. 

<!--more-->
This project was particularly difficult on receiving the updates from Health Kit while the app was in the background. It was a interesting challenge to orchestrate the timing of life cycles between iOS and React Native layers.


## My role in this project
- Researched lifecycles of ReactNative and iOS apps.
- Made a prototype to enable React Native layer to get awaken while the app is in the background.
- Delivered the ReactNative SDK to enable background data stream from iOS HealthKit.
