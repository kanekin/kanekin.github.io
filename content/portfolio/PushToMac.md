PushToMac is an iOS app to remind yourself about the task you want to be done with. Available on AppStore for Mac and iOS.

<!--more-->

It allows you to add a task, and the app will remind you next time you open the mac. 

Although the app is very simple, implementing the features implied by the user's gesture is more complex. It was a nice learning experience to implement Mac and iOS apps from the same code base using SwiftUI. 

Technologies used in this project:
- iCloud as backend
- SwiftUI single codebase for Mac and iOS
- CoreData
- InApp Purchase
