## Motivation
Earth history is a fascinating and important subject. But it is also a tricky subject to learn. Because there are so many different types of events, the numbers you have to deal with are incomprehensively large. I have always been interested in the subject. But it's been challenging to understand how those events relate to each other.

I think digital solutions can provide a better way to learn these massive scale histories than static diagrams. With dynamic graphs you can interact with, you should be able to compare the events you are interested in and understand the relationships among them relatively. By utilizing AR, we can turn too large a number to comprehend into something intuitively understandable.
